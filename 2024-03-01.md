# March 1, 2024

## Tasks in progress
- [ ] Maintainance tasks EOL
    - [ ] Verdict implementation not working - need to modify code a bit in *MainControl* `constructor`
      > In existing codebase, it is *very difficult to know the status of certain channel* because of **hardcoded strings**
      > Also understand CTI dll better
    - [ ] Ambient temperature - reopen task for refactor
      > Add setting in `ArbinSettings` to customize whether temperature is to be *manually input by OP* or to be *read from TestProfile acceptance criteria*
- [ ] EOLWA
    - [x] Environment preparation
    - [>] Waiting for next tasks
    - [>] Figure out barcode scanner implementation once it is available
    - [>] Print **QR code** sticker - familiar with pdf libraries in js, can keep using those
      > Simplest implementation would be htmlToPdf.js (QR code is already being generated somewhere? [^ref1] we can simply print that html?)
