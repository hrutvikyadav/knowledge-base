## 1 - Introduction
## 2 - Commodity Hardware Today
## 3 - CPU caches ‼️

CPU's today are orders of magnitude faster than those 25 years ago.
Back then the *frequency* of a *CPU core* was *similar* to that of the *memory bus*
> In the 90's things changed as
> - `CPU` designers *increased* frequency.
> - frequency of `memory` bus *did not increase proportionally*.
>   This is *not because* it was *not possible to do so*; but because it was **very expensive to do** it.

>> RAM as fast as the current CPU cores is far more expensive than any slower dynamic RAM

#working-set

32GB RAM

|working-set  | --> occupied by a program (like neovim)

```
If there are 2 options
1. Small, very fast RAM
2. Large, comparatively fast RAM
The second will always win because we need to account for swap memory as well. i.e. If the #working-set for a program exceeds the size of RAM, some "pages" will swapped to disk.
Every time something is needed which is not in the RAM, it will fetch from disk (which is again, slower).
Which means the second system which has large size of RAM will win because it can hold the entire #working-set in memory which means it avoids any disk access.

> [!hint]
> However this does not mean that all of the programs layout has to fit in the RAM or there is nothing we can do.
> In fact, a computer can have small smount of SRAM along with large amount of DRAM.
> One implementation can be to dedicate certain processor address space to SRAM and the rest to the DRAM. The OS would then take care of optimally distibuting data between the two. But htis is so much overhead that it nullifies the point of having the fast SRAM available in the first place.
> Another implementation can be make it so that instead of putting the SRAM under the control of the OS or the user, it will be directly administered by the CPU. IN this mode, the SRAM is allowed to make temporary copies of data(which is likely to be used soon by CPU) in the main memory. In other words the SRAM will cache the most likely used data.
>> [!tip]
>> Identifying this most likely used data is possible because temporal and spatial locality.
>> TODO: Explain temporal and spatial locality more.
