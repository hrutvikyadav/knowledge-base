# Intro

Confidently apply real-time embedded C

## Standards

We will mainly use C89 because it is the most widely adopted, along with that we will use some [[C99]] and some [[C11]]

[[Working with larger programs]]
[[Storage Classes]]
[[Advanced Data Types]]
[[Type Qualifiers]]
[[Bit Manipulation]]
[[Advanced Control Flow]]
[[Input Output]]
[[Function concepts]]
[[Unions]]
[[Preprocessor Concepts]]
[[Macros]]
[[Debugging and Compiler flags]]
[[Static Libraries and Shared Objects]]
[[Advanced Pointers]]
[[Useful C libraries]]
[[Data Structures]]
[[IPC]]
[[Threads]]
[[Advanced Networking]]

## Goals

- write advanced C programs
- write high quality, modular code, with low coupling
- master problem solving with proven methods
