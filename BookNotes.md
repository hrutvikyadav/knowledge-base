# BookNotes

## Notes before reading
- Three easy pieces/concepts are
  1. Virtualization
  2. Concurrency
  3. Persistence
  > **History** behind concepts is also explained for clearer understanding
- Each *major concept* is divided into *set of chapters*
- **Crux of the problem** is presented and *material that solves the problem is provided*
- Timelines to describe *behaviour of systems over **time***
- Asides and Tips
  > i.e. **some relevant info** and **some lessons we can apply to systems we build in real life**
- Each **major section** in book introduces an *`abstraction`* provided by OS and next chapters work on how such abstraction is provided
- Throughout the book, [real code examples](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code) are provided for *practicing on a real system*
- Homework simulations
- Projects of 2 types
  1. For people new to UNIX/C
  2. For people with some exp who can dive into a real kernel to get their hands dirty
- LASTLY, *references to original material*[^ogrefs] for the **ideas in field of `Operating Systems`** are provided and should be noted
  > This also helps in understanding history behind said ideas

## Dialogue
> How an OS decides what program to run next on a CPU, how it handles memory overload in a virtual memory system, how virtual machine monitors work,
> how to manage information on disks, and even a little about how to build a distributed system that works when parts have failed

## Chapters
1. Virtualization
2. Concurrency
3. Persistence

### Introduction to Operating Systems
