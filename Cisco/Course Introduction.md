## Tools used in the course
Cisco packet tracer for simulation of network devices and connections
> The free Cisco Packet Tracer software helps you to practice your network configuration and troubleshooting skills using your desktop or laptop computer. It allows you to simulate networks without having access to physical equipment. In addition to networking, you can learn, and then practice your Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity skills. You can choose to build a network from scratch, use a pre-built sample network, or complete lab assignments. While Packet Tracer is not a replacement for practicing on physical routers, switches, firewalls, and servers, it provides many benefits
