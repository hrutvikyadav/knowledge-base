# Design Patterns

## Catagories of patterns (GOF)

1. Creational
   - Singleton
     Refers to having only one instance of a class.
   - Factory
     A **factory method** is defined in a class for ==creating objects of a particular type==. Along with an *abstract* create* method that ==*subclasses* implement to produce actual objects==.
2. Structural
   - Facade
     A facade is an object that provides a ==*simplified interface* to a larger body/subsystem of code==, such as a **class library**(*which is complex*).
   - Adapter
     Adapter pattern works as a *bridge between two incompatible interfaces*. Adapter ==wraps the existing class with a new interface== so that it becomes compatible with the client.
3. Behavioral
