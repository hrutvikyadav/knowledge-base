# Encounter

1. Getting started 
   - [[Imperative programming]]
   - [[Compiling and running]]
   - Summary 
     > C is designed to give computers orders. Thereby it mediates between us (the programmers) and computers.
     > C must be compiled to be executed. The compiler provides the translation between the language that we understand (C) and the specific needs of the particular platform.
     > C gives a level of abstraction that provides portability. One C program can be used on many different computer architectures.
     > The C compiler is there to help you. If it warns you about something in your program, listen to it
2. The principal structure of a program 
   - Grammar
   - Declarations
   - Definitions
   - Statements
   - Summary
     > C distinguishes the lexical structure (the punctuators, identifiers, and numbers), the grammatical structure (syntax), and the semantics (meaning) of programs.
     > All identifiers (names) must be declared such that we know the properties of the concept they represent.
     > All objects (things that we deal with) and functions (methods that we use to deal with things) must be defined; that is, we must specify how and where they come to be.
     > Statements indicate how things are going to be done: iterations (for) repeat variations of a certain tasks, functions calls (printf(...)) delegate a task to a function, and function returns (return something;) go back where we came from.
