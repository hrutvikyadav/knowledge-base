## First class functions
These are **functions** that can be _used as values_ in all the places where other values like integers can be used.
i.e. functions can be ðŸ‘‡
- stored in variables
- computed and used in expressions
- passed around to other functions
- returned from other functions
- etc...
## Closures
These are functions that can use ==variables defined outside== of them[^fcf+c]
## Higher order functions
They either *take* or *return* other functions

## General definition for FP
### The 2 major concepts in FP are
1. Immutable data
2. Using functions as values

[^fcf+c]: First class functions and closures are often used together for building powerful features
