# What is it
A standardized collection ofÂ [header files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/header_file "w:header file")Â and library routines used to _implement common programming operations_
Example ðŸ‘‡
- IO operations
- Character string operations
==Built in keywords for these tasks do not exist in `C`==
> [!tip]
> Most `C` programs rely on __standard library__ 

# ANSI C standard library
After 1970's C became very popular and _many people_ came up with their _own implementation_ of the `C` language. The __incompatibilities__ started to show and in 1989 the ANSI came up with a standardized specification of `C` language called `C89`
> A part of `C89` is the `ANSI C` standard library - a set of 24 header files that include function declarations macros type declarations

Later versions added more header files like those that are available by default in other languages
