# MPU learning plan

Migration Preparation Plan (3 Months)
Since your application is network-heavy and moving from an STM32 MCU to an STM32MPU, you’ll need to focus on Linux, Embedded C++, Networking, and Performance Benchmarking.

# Phase 1: Understanding Embedded Linux & MPUs (Week 1-4)
## Learn Embedded Linux Basics
Since MPUs run Linux, you should get familiar with:

- Boot process (U-Boot, kernel, root filesystem)
- Device trees and driver development
- Interfacing with hardware (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C)
- File system layout and persistent storage

📌 Resources

📖 "Mastering Embedded Linux Programming" by Chris Simmonds
📖 "Embedded Linux Primer: A Practical Real-World Approach" by Christopher Hallinan
🎥 Free Electrons - Embedded Linux Course
📝 Yocto Project for building custom Linux images

## Work With Your STM32MPU Board

Get familiar with STM32CubeMX for MPU
Flash and boot Linux
Play with GPIO and peripherals from userspace
📌 Resources

📝 STM32MP1 Developer Wiki
🎥 ST’s YouTube tutorials on STM32MP1
# Phase 2: C++ for Embedded Systems (Week 3-6)
Since you'll be using C++, focus on embedded-friendly patterns and best practices for performance and memory efficiency.

## Learn Embedded C++ Best Practices

Avoid dynamic memory allocation (use fixed-size buffers, placement new)
Use std::array, std::span instead of raw pointers
RAII for resource management
Learn how to write low-overhead C++
📌 Resources

📖 "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers
📖 "Embedded C++: Hands-on Programming with Embedded Systems in C++" by Maya Posch
📝 CppCon Talks on Embedded C++
📝 ST’s C++ Guidelines

## Hands-on: Write a simple C++ app on the STM32MPU

Implement GPIO, UART, and networking in C++
Use std::thread vs. pthread in Linux
# Phase 3: Networking and Performance Benchmarking (Week 6-9)
Since networking is at the heart of your application, you need to ensure high performance and low latency.

## Networking in Linux & C++

Learn how to write high-performance networked applications
Use Raw Sockets, TCP/UDP, and Zero-Copy Networking
Test latency & throughput
📌 Resources

📖 "UNIX Network Programming" by W. Richard Stevens
📝 Beej’s Guide to Network Programming

## Performance Testing & Benchmarking

Use iperf for network benchmarking
Use valgrind, perf, and strace for performance analysis
📌 Tools & Guides

📝 Linux perf
📝 Measuring network latency

# Phase 4: Testing & Industry Standards (Week 9-12)

## Unit Testing for Embedded C++

Learn GoogleTest (gtest) for writing unit tests
Mock hardware dependencies using gmock

📌 Resources

Implement secure network programming

📌 Resources
📝 [MISRA C++ Guidelines](https://www.misra.org.uk/)
📝 OWASP Guide for Embedded Security
Final Steps & Migration Strategy

## Setup a Parallel Dev Environment

Work with STM32MPU, Linux, and C++ together
Port key features from MCU to MPU

## Measure Performance Gains

Benchmark network latency
Profile CPU/memory for efficiency
Conclusion
Since you already know C and some C++, this plan ensures that in 3 months, you’ll be ready to migrate:

✅ Linux & embedded MPU experience
✅ High-performance C++ networking
✅ Testing & benchmarking best practices
