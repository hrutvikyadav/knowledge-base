# Memory Management

Memory is like a scratchpad for OS to write temp stuff related to processes; which we can afford to lose.
Similar to registers being scratchpad for CPU.
So why even use this temporary storage? Because writing/reading to it is very fast compared to persistent storage i.e. disk.

## Types
1. Volatile Memory (RAM)
    - SRAM - Static RAM
    - DRAM - Dynamic RAM
2. Non Volatile Memory (ROM)

## CPU read/write from/to Memory
