# ModernC

The book is ==divided into levels==. The *levels* represent *familiarity* with the C programming language

Ideas presented in the book are universally applicable to all programming languages. But the *primary focus* is on **practices unique to** `C` programming language that are **valuable** in the modern world.

> [!tip]  C has been in a continuous process of adjustment and improvement and has undergone an important standardization and extension process, now driven by ISO, the International Standards Organization.
> This led to the publication of a series of C standards in 1989, 1999, 2011, and 2018, commonly referred to as `C89`, `C99`, `C11`, and `C17`. Standards maintain backward compatibility, so code written in C89 should compile and run correctly in a C17 environment.
> *However, this should not be an excuse for older codebases to not update their code to the latest standards and take advantage of the new features and improvements.*

> [!info] The book refers to `C17` as defined in ==JTC1/SC22/WG14 ( 2018 )==

## Level 0
[[Encounter]]
> Summarizes the very basics of programming with C. Its principal role is to remind you of the main concepts we have mentioned and familiarize you with the special vocabulary and viewpoints that C applies
> **GOAL**: understand the structure of simple C programs and start writing your own

## Level 1
[[Aquaintance]]
> Details most principal concepts and features such as control structures, data types, operators, and functions. It should give you a deeper understanding 
> **GOAL**: Should be able to understand an introductory course in algorithms and other work at that level, with the notable *caveat that pointers are not covered in this level*

## Level 2
[[Cognition]]
> Explores heart of the language, pointers, and memory management and most of C's library interfaces. Also discusses organization of C programs.
> **GOAL**: Should be able to write C code professionally and understand the majority of existing C codebases

## Level 3
[[Experience]]
> Goes into detail about specific topics, such as performance, reentrancy, atomicity, threads, and type-generic programming. These are best discovered as you need them in real-world projects. But it is important to know these to gain full expertise in C.
