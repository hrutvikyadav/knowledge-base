# Overview
[[OS Overview]]
## Task/Responsibility of `OS`
Manages the `hardware` for the `user`,
so that user can perform, for ex, **computing tasks or development tasks**
> In short OS helps the user accomplish hardware related tasks

OS can be designed for different systems like PC, mobiles, servers etc
Regardless of the system/device the core goal of the OS is common ðŸ‘‡
	managing something, making use of the hardware, and providing an interface to the user
The OS runs the tasks that user wants, without interrupting the process[^errors], and communicates[^info] with the computer hardware without knowing computer's language
## Alternatives to using `OS` to talk to `hardware`
1. Bypass the OS and talk directly to h/w (registers and so on)
    Low level programming knowledge is needed for this
	> this is equivalent of *doing your tasks yourself*
2. Use [[Kernel]] to talk to h/w
    System programming knowledge is required for interacting with [[Kernel]] and getting tasks done
    > this is equivalent of *asking maid to do your tasks (in the house analogy)*

[^errors]: otherwise it's an error
[^info]: such as errors, information related to running programs etc
# History of `OS`
## Situation before `OS`'s existed
## First `OS`
Batch processing
## Next generations of `OS`'s
Multiprogramming
Minicomputers
Personal Computers
> [!info]
> Today all electronic devices run `OS` designed for them
