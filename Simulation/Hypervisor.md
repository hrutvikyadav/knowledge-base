A hypervisor, also known as a *virtual machine monitor* or `VMM`, isÂ **software that *creates and runs* virtual machines (VMs) on a single host computer**.
> It allows one host computer to *support multiple guest VMs* by **virtually sharing its resources**, such as memory and processing. The hypervisor **allocates** the underlying physical computing resources such as CPU, memory and network bandwidth to individual VMs **as required**.

Some examples are ðŸ‘‡
1. KVM
2. Xen
3. Hax
4. Hypervisor.Framework
